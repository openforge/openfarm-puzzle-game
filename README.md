# Instructions

1. Clone the repository using 'Use template' (and don't forget to give us a Star / Follow on Github, please!)
2. Search + Replace all instances of 'example-app-angular-e2e' with your app name (important to do this first)
3. Search + Replace all instances of 'example-app-angular' with your app name
4. Change the folder names for example-app-angular and example-app-angular-e2e to what you named for steps #1 and #2
5. Search + Replace all instances of 'openfarm-puzzle-game2.0' with your project name
6. Search + Replace 'openforge' with your company name.  This is the NX project scope that allows you to import libraries using @openforge

That's it for the renaming!  Now to test..
